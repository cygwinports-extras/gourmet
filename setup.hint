ldesc: "Gourmet Recipe Manager is a manager, editor, and organizer for
recipes. It currently has primitive support for mealmaster
importing. It can export and import an XML format of its own (the DTD
is included here for your interest) which I developed for an earlier
recipe program in emacs-lisp. It also allows you to export individual
recipes as Mealmaster, HTML or Plain Text."
